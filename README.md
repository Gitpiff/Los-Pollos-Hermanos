# Los-Pollos-Hermanos

The idea behind this app is to create a recipe book that everyone can access but only the Chef/Owner can modify.
This App allows the Chef to create/update/delete recipes, so he/she can control the menu as well as the ingredient list, and how the dish will be prepared. 
Only the Chef can do this, the cooks will only have access to the information the Chef writes.
